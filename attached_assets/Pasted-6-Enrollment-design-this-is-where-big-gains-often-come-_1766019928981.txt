6) Enrollment design (this is where big gains often come)

“Define the enrollment policy: how many segments per speaker are used, any caps, any quality filters, and how the centroid is computed.”

“Explain the --normalize flag precisely: when normalization happens (per-embedding vs centroid) and whether it affects stored vectors.”

“What metadata is written into the enrollment PKL (dataset, split, timestamps, preprocessing flags, counts, speaker list)?”

“Does enroll.py support producing multiple outputs in one run? If yes, explain how it’s implemented and what stays identical.”

7) Scoring backend and decision rule

“Define the scoring function used at inference (cosine similarity). Is it raw dot product on L2-normalized vectors or computed another way?”

“How is Top-K produced (full sort vs partial)? Any ties handling?”

“Is there any thresholding or ‘unknown’ label logic? If not, where would it plug in?”

8) Z-norm (score normalization) implementation correctness

“Explain z-norm implementation end-to-end: cohort definition, how μ/σ are computed per speaker, and how they’re applied at inference.”

“Confirm how --cohort-size works: is it ‘top-N most similar impostors’ and how is similarity computed?”

“Explain sigma-floor and reliability: how ‘unreliable’ is defined, how fallback to raw cosine is implemented, and where.”

“Does add_znorm.py modify PKLs in place safely (atomic write, backups)? Describe failure modes.”

9) Evaluation reports (what exactly gets printed/saved)

“List every metric produced by sid_evaluator: Top-1/3/5, per-speaker precision/recall, sink speaker report, confusion pairs. Where is each computed?”

“Explain the confusion table generation: how counts are aggregated and how the ‘Top confusions’ list is built.”

“Confirm the exact definition of ‘sink speaker’ used (predicted >= N with precision < X). Are N and X configurable?”

10) Audio quality analysis (paper-ready dataset characterization)

“Explain how rms_db, peak_amp, and clip_ratio are computed (formulae, thresholds). Are signals assumed in [-1,1]?”

“Does the tool sample all files or subset? Does it preprocess before measuring? Clarify.”

“Where is the --audio-quality flag parsed and how does it select folders/splits?”
