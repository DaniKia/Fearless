/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/speechbrain/utils/torch_audio_backend.py:57: UserWarning: torchaudio._backend.list_audio_backends has been deprecated. This deprecation is part of a large refactoring effort to transition TorchAudio into a maintenance phase. The decoding and encoding capabilities of PyTorch for both audio and video are being consolidated into TorchCodec. Please see https://github.com/pytorch/audio/issues/3902 for more information. It will be removed from the 2.9 release.
