List the modules/scripts I implemented, what each does, and why it exists. Include:

main ASR entrypoint(s)

SID entrypoint(s)

enrollment script

preprocessing pipeline + configuration design

evaluation/report generation

utilities (audio quality metrics, etc.)
For each bullet: component name → purpose → key behavior.

C) What I used off-the-shelf (bullet list)

List external models and libraries, grouped by role:

ASR model(s) used (name, where loaded from, how invoked)

Speaker embedding model(s) used (SpeechBrain model name/checkpoint if present)

Core frameworks (torch/torchaudio, etc.)

Audio tooling (librosa/scipy/soundfile)

Metrics (jiwer WER/CER, SID accuracy/confusion matrix if implemented)
Include versions if specified (requirements file or install strings). If not visible, say “version not pinned.”

D) Technical design choices worth mentioning (bullet list)

Explain the non-obvious engineering decisions that improve reproducibility and experimentation, such as:

separation of Audio I/O vs Audio Preprocessing

dataclass config for preprocessing flags

PKL artifacts storing metadata (preprocessing settings, dataset info, timestamp)

automatic loading of preprocessing settings from PKL at inference time

CLI-first interface and Colab compatibility

E) Experiments & results summary (table + bullets)

Look for evaluation outputs or report files and summarize:

Baseline vs preprocessing variants

Any normalization experiments (L2 normalization, z-norm)

Any resampling/upsampling impact
Provide a table with: run name, enrollment split, test split, top-1/top-3/top-5 (or other metrics), and notes.
If results are not in repo, output “results not present in repository” and list which scripts would generate them.

F) Reproducibility instructions (5–10 lines)

Give exact commands to reproduce:

enrollment creation

adding z-norm (if present)

running SID evaluation across multiple PKLs

running ASR evaluation
Use the real CLI flags from --help or code.

G) 5 “defense-ready” talking points (numbered)

These should be technically credible points I can say in a presentation, e.g.:

what the pipeline proves (ablation-ready, avoids confounds)

what improved performance most and why (if results exist)

what pitfalls were found (e.g., score normalization instability) and how mitigated (sigma floor / cohort)

what’s next (quality-based enrollment selection, calibration, PLDA, faster-whisper optional)

Professional, factual, and optimized for a 15-minute project presentation. Use clear headings and bullets. Avoid marketing language.
